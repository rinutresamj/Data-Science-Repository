# DATA SCIENCE
This repository contains data science projects done by me for academic as well for self learning purposes.Projects are in the form of iPython Notebooks.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
  * ### EDA on Zomato Dataset
  Performed data analysis on Zomato dataset to learn more about transactions,online delivery ,ratings etc and visualised using matplotlib and seaborn 
  * ### Analysis of Weather DataSet
   Performed data analysis on weather dataset using pandas
  * ### EDA and Feature Engineering on Black Friday dataset
   Performed data analysis and feature engineering on Black Friday dataset .Mainly aimed to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount)      against various products of different categories. Visualised using  matplotlib and seaborn 
  * ### EDA and Feature Engineering on Flight Price Prediction
  Performed EDA and Feature engineering using pandas and sklearn
   * ### EDA with Time series Data
   Performed EDA with Tesla dataset.Used yfinance library to extract the dataset.
## Machine Learning
   * ### Heart Disease Prediction
   Created a machine learning model to predict whether a person has heart disease or not ,using logistic regression
   * ### SVM Project using Iris Flower Dataset
   Created a machine learning model using SVM to classify Iris Fowers
   * ### KMeans Clustering
   Studied KMeans Clustering by using artificial data.
   * ###  KMeans Clustering Project
   Used KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.
   * ### KNearest Neighbours
   Performed KNearest Neighbours Algorithm and found out the value of k using elbow method
## Python
   * ### Movie Recommendation system
   This project recommends similar movies based on the movie name given by the user.
